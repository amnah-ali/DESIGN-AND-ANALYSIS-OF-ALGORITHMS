# DESIGN-AND-ANALYSIS-OF-ALGORITHMS
DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS

This project is a demonstration of a set of sorting algorithms. For each algorithm: 
1) there is an introduction,
2) explanation of the code component,
3) the running time complexity, 
4) when the algorithm is suitable to use, 
5) and improvement suggestions.
6)After that, there will be the code itself,
7) followed by graphs representation, and 
8) a result discussion.

The sorting algorithms are:
1) Selection_sort
2) Insertion_sort
3) Quick_sort
    a) Regular quick sort, Quick_sort
    b) quick sort using 3 medians, Quick_sort3
4) Merge_sort
5) Bubble_sort
6) Heap_sort

finally, at the end of the file, there is a general comparison table and points.

The code has a set of functions to generate the graphs.
1) when the array is unsorted for an array size of 10 and 1000.
2) when the array is sorted
3) finally when the array in reversed order.
